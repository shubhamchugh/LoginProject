        <h3><strong>8. General Provisions</strong></h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or
                        permanently, the site (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that we shall not
                        be liable to
                        you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the service. If
                        any
                        provision of these terms of use, for any reason, be declared void, illegal, invalid, or
                        unenforceable in
                        whole or in part, such provision will be severable from all other provisions herein and will not
                        affect or
                        impair the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these terms of use; provided,
                        however, that
                        a court having jurisdiction may revise such provision to the extent necessary to make such
                        provision valid
                        and enforceable. The laws of the State of Arkansas, U.S.A. govern all matters arising out of
                        these terms of
                        use, without giving effect to any conflicts or choice of laws principles that would require the
                        application
                        of the laws of a different jurisdiction. Any dispute or claim arising out of or in relation to
                        these terms
                        of use, or the interpretation, making, performance, breach or termination thereof, will be
                        finally settled
                        by the courts of Faulkner County, Arkansas, U.S.A. and of any federal court located in the
                        eastern district
                        of Arkansas. No waiver of any provision of these terms of use by us shall be deemed a further or
                        continuing
                        waiver of such provision or any other provision, and our failure to assert any right or
                        provision under
                        these terms of use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any waiver of any
                        provision of
                        these terms of use will be effective only if in writing and signed by Inuvo. We may immediately
                        terminate
                        these terms of use with respect to you (including your access to our site, or any portion
                        thereof) without
                        cause and without notice to you in our sole discretion. Upon termination, you must cease use of
                        our site.
                        The provisions of these terms of use, which by their nature should survive the termination of
                        these terms of
                        use, shall so survive such termination. These terms of use along with any other notices,
                        policies,
                        procedures, agreements, and terms and conditions on our site contain the entire understanding
                        with respect
                        to your use of our site and our relationship with you and such shall supersede all prior
                        understandings and
                        agreements, whether written or oral, and all prior dealings. You agree that regardless of any
                        statute or law
                        to the contrary, any cause of action against us arising out of or related to our site must
                        commence within
                        one (1) year after the cause of action accrues or such cause of action shall be permanently
                        barred.</span>
